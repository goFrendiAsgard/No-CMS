Formed in August 2006 by four high school girls, they started playing street lives until they were noticed and signed to the indie label Kitty Records. In 2008, they released three singles and a mini-album while performing shows in the United States, France, and Hong Kong. That October, Scandal released their major debut single, &quot;Doll&quot;, under Epic Records Japan.'.PHP_EOL.'</p>'.PHP_EOL.'<p style="text-align: justify;">'.PHP_EOL.'    The band has performed the theme songs for many anime, including &quot;Shōjo S&quot; for Bleach and &quot;Shunkan Sentimental&quot; for Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. With numerous overseas performances and anime theme songs, Scandal has built a considerable international fanbase.'.PHP_EOL.'</p>'.PHP_EOL.'<div style="page-break-after: always;">'.PHP_EOL.'    <span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>'.PHP_EOL.'</div>'.PHP_EOL.'<h3 style="text-align: justify;">'.PHP_EOL.'    Indie career'.PHP_EOL.'</h3>'.PHP_EOL.'<p style="text-align: justify;">'.PHP_EOL.'    Scandal was formed in August 2006 by four high school girls. The girls, Haruna, Mami, Tomomi, and Rina, met in an Osaka vocal and dance school called Caless. Shortly thereafter, they started performing street lives every weekend at Shiroten in Osaka Castle Park. Soon, they started getting offers from clubs in Osaka and Kyoto. The band&#39;s name originates from a sign near Studio Brotherz, a studio where they practiced in their early days. The studio is on the sixth floor of a building shared with other businesses, namely adult shops. The girls decided to choose the biggest sign among the shops, &quot;Scandal&quot; (スキャンダル Sukyandaru?), as the name for their band.'.PHP_EOL.'</p>'.PHP_EOL.'<p style="text-align: justify;">'.PHP_EOL.'    Scandal signed with indie label Kitty Records and released three singles exclusive to Tower Records in 2008. The first, &quot;Space Ranger&quot;, ranked #2 on the Tower indie charts and the other two, &quot;Koi Moyō&quot; and &quot;Kagerō&quot;, ranked #1. In March, they embarked on the Japan Nite US tour 2008, touring six major cities in the United States. They also performed at Sakura-Con, one of the largest anime conventions in the United States. In July, they performed in front of 10,000 people at France&#39;s Japan Expo and also at Hong Kong&#39;s Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong in August.

The song is a new version of their indie song, &quot;Sakura&quot;, only heard live.
