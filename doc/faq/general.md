General FAQ
===========

__PS:__ For technical FAQ, please click [here](technical.md)

* __Why do you make No-CMS?__

    Because I need it in my work. And I think many CodeIgniter developer will need it too. I lost nothing by share it to everyone, instead I get a lot of feedback to make No-CMS more stable.

* __Is there a premium or paid version of No-CMS?__

    No there is not.

* __Why do you use CodeIgniter 3.0 development version?__

    Because I need PDO support to hook up with postgresql & sqlite.

* __Why don't you use the newest version of CodeIgniter 3.0 development version?__

    Because the newest 3.0 has [new file name convention](https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/commit/20292311636837e120d205e470e41826820feb46). I'm afraid this will affect a lot of No-CMS user. In this case, I think backward compatibility matter. Actually I have try to modify CodeIgniter core so that it will has backward-compatibility, but I found there is an issue with HMVC. So I decide to stop and write the documentation instead.

* __Your English is terrible, there are a lot of grammatical error in the documentation. Can I help you to write a better documentation?__

    Sure. I know it. And I probably need your help. Just open the documentation on github, and click edit.

* __Are you a Pinoy?__

    No, I am not a Pinoy, I am an Indonesian. You might never heard of Indonesia before, but you might have ever heard about Bali or Komodo. But no, I'm not living in Bali, and I never see komodo by myself.

* __How can I make my own custom theme and module?__

    [Here](tutorial/designer_themes.md) is how to make theme, and [here](tutorial/programmer_modules.md) is how to make module.

* __Why did you delete the old pdf documentation and use this instead? I prefer to see the documentation offline__

    This kind of user guide is more colaborative. Someone can edit it, I approve the changes, and everything changed. It is also visible online (without any need to download the entire documentation). To see the documentation offline, please scroll up a bit. I write the guide in the beginning section with a big title.

* __CodeIgniter sucks. Don't you want to switch to other framework?__

    Yes I know CodeIgniter sucks, but I never think that other framework is better (no offense here). I have try several PHP frameworks and always come back to CodeIgniter. However, I also try to write a better framework called [kokoropy](https://github.com/goFrendiAsgard/kokoropy) in Python.

* __Will you stop No-CMS development?__

    I don't have any intention to stop the development. Some of my job is still related to `PHP`-`Mysql` stuff (although I think `Python` is better). Most server is still use PHP & MySQL. This is the biggest market trend. And No-CMS works well so far. People seems to look for PHP program since there are a lot of PHP developer out there. CodeIgniter is still one of big player here. No-CMS make CodeIgniter-based website development easier, so there is no reason to stop the development of No-CMS.
